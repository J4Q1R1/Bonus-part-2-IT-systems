# Contributing

This page explains how to contribute to the handbook.

## How to suggest changes

1. Navigate to the page you would like to change
2. Click on "Edit this page on GitHub" and the "Edit this file" button
3. Add your changes in [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
4. Commit the changes to a new branch
5. Assign the maintainer to review and merge your changes

## Principles

- We prefer simple, structured, and actionable checklists
- Confidential data, such as grades and student identities should not be stored in the handbook
- Add links to other parts of the handbook or external resources to avoid replicating contents
